---Represents a Discord guild member. Though one user may be a member in more than one guild, each presence is represented by a different member object associated with that guild. Note that any method or property that exists for the User class is also available in the Member class.
---@class Member: UserPresence
---@field public roles ArrayIterable An iterable array of guild roles that the member has. This does not explicitly include the default everyone role. Object order is not guaranteed.
---@field public name string If the member has a nickname, then this will be equivalent to that nickname. Otherwise, this is equivalent to `Member.user.username`.
---@field public nickname string | nil The member's nickname, if one is set.
---@field public joinedAt string | nil The date and time at which the current member joined the guild, represented as an ISO 8601 string plus microseconds when available. Member objects generated via presence updates lack this property.
---@field public premiumSince string | nil The date and time at which the current member boosted the guild, represented as an ISO 8601 string plus microseconds when available.
---@field public voiceChannel GuildVoiceChannel | nil The voice channel to which this member is connected in the current guild.
---@field public muted boolean Whether the member is voice muted in its guild.
---@field public deafened boolean Whether the member is voice deafened in its guild.
---@field public guild Guild The guild in which this member exists.
---@field public highestRole Role The highest positioned role that the member has. If the member has no explicit roles, then this is equivalent to `Member.guild.defaultRole`.

---@return Color
function Member:getColor() end
---Checks whether the member has a specific permission. If `channel` is omitted, then only guild-level permissions are checked. This is a relatively expensive operation. If you need to check multiple permissions at once, use the `getPermissions` method and check the resulting object.
---@param channel GuildChannel
---@param perm Permissions | number
---@return boolean
function Member:hasPermission(channel, perm) end

---The main point of entry into a Discordia application. All data relevant to Discord is accessible through a client instance or its child objects after a connection to Discord is established with the `run` method. In other words, client data should not be expected and most client methods should not be called until after the `ready` event is received. Base emitter methods may be called at any time.

---Authenticates the current user via HTTPS and launches as many WSS gateway shards as are required or requested. By using coroutines that are automatically managed by Luvit libraries and a libuv event loop, multiple clients per process and multiple shards per client can operate concurrently. This should be the last method called after all other code and event handlers have been initialized.

--- The Lua language does not have classes, but it does have all of the tools needed to write them.
--- Discordia uses a custom class system that was written explicitly to encapsulate data provided by Discord in intuitive, efficient structures.
---
--- The `class` module used by Discordia is available to users in the main Discordia module.
--- The class module is both the module table and a callable class constructor.
---
--- ```lua
--- local discordia = require('discordia')
--- local class = discordia.class
--- ```
---
--- ## Constructing Classes and Objects
---
--- All Discordia classes must be uniquely named and must have an `__init` method.
--- `UpperCamelCase` is used for class names while `lowerCamelCase` is used for public instances, properties, and methods.
---
--- ```lua
--- local Apple = class('Apple') -- construct a new class
---
--- function Apple:__init(color) -- define the initializer
---   ...
--- end
---
--- local apple = Apple('red') -- call the class table to instantiate a new object
--- ```
---
--- ## Properties
---
--- Discordia enforces a "protected" property policy.
--- All new properties written directly to class objects must be prefixed with an underscore.
--- Directly accessing underscored properties outside of the class definitions is not recommended.
--- Additionally, to avoid potential compatibility issues, **writing custom properties to pre-defined Discordia classes is not recommended**.
---
--- ```lua
--- local Apple = class('Apple')
---
--- function Apple:__init(color)
---	self._color = color -- define a "protected" property
--- end
--- ```
---
--- Because of this underscore policy, Discordia classes also have **getters** and **setters** that can be used to define public properties.
--- These are empty tables and should be populated by functions where getters return a value and setters modify a property.
--- Note that an explicit `self` must be passed for these functions.
---
--- ```lua
--- local Apple, get, set = class('Apple') -- multiple return values
---
--- function Apple:__init(color)
---	self._color = color
--- end
---
--- function get.color(self) -- define a getter
---	return self._color
--- end
---
--- function set.color(self, color) -- define a setter
---   self._color = color
--- end
--- ```
---
--- With getters and setters, you can indirectly get/access and set/mutate protected (underscored) properties without having to use a method.
--- More importantly, if a setter is not defined for a specific property, Discordia will prevent users from overwriting that property.
--- Note Discordia itself never uses setters, but the option is available for people who want to make their own classes.
---
--- ```lua
--- local apple = Apple('red')
--- print(apple.color) -- 'red'
---
--- apple.color = 'green'
--- print(apple.color) -- 'green'
--- ```
---
--- ### Member Methods
---
--- Member methods are defined and called using Lua's colon notation so that an implicit `self` is passed to the function.
---
--- ```lua
--- local Apple = class('Apple')
---
--- function Apple:__init(color)
---	self._color = color
--- end
---
--- function Apple:getColor() -- define a member method
---   return self._color
--- end
---
--- local user = Apple('red')
--- print(user:getColor()) -- 'red'
--- ```
---
--- ### Static Methods
---
--- Static methods are defined and called using Lua's dot notation.
--- No implicit (or explicit) self is required for static methods.
---
--- ```lua
--- local colors = {'red', 'yellow', 'green'}
---
--- function Apple.random() -- returns a random apple object
---	return Apple(colors[math.random(#colors)])
--- end
--- ```
---
--- ## Inheritance
---
--- Discordia classes support single and multiple inheritance.
--- Base or super classes are passed to the class constructor.
---
--- ```lua
--- local Fruit = class('Fruit') -- Fruit is a base class
---
--- function Fruit:__init(color)
---	self._color = color
--- end
---
--- function Fruit:getColor()
---	return self._color
--- end
---
--- local Apple = class('Apple', Fruit) -- Apple inherits from Fruit
---
--- function Apple:__init(color)
--- 	Fruit.__init(self, color) -- base constructor must be explicitly called
--- end
---
--- local apple = Apple('red')
---
--- print(apple:getColor()) -- 'red'; method inherited from Fruit
--- ```
---
--- ## Utilities
---
--- The class module contains a variety of tables and functions that may be useful to regular users.
---
--- #### classes
---
--- Table of all defined classes, indexed by name.
---
---@class class
---@field public classes table<string, any>
local class = {}

--- Function that returns true only if the provided argument is a Discordia class module.
---
--- ```lua
--- print(class.isClass(Color)) -- true
--- print(class.isClass(1337)) -- false
--- ```
---@param obj any
---@return boolean
function class.isClass(obj) end

--- Function that returns true only if the provided argument is an instance of a Discordia class.
---
--- ```lua
--- local color = Color(...)
--- print(class.isObject(color)) -- true
--- print(class.isObject(1337)) -- false
--- ```
---@param obj any
---@return boolean
function class.isObject(obj) end

--- Function that returns true if the first argument is a subclass of the second argument.
--- Note that classes are considered to be subclasses of themselves.
---
--- ```lua
--- print(class.isSubclass(TextChannel, Channel)) -- true
--- print(class.isSubclass(Color, Channel)) -- false
--- print(class.isSubclass(Channel, Channel)) -- true
--- ```
---@param obj any
---@param obj2 any
---@return boolean
function class.isSubclass(obj, obj2) end

--- Function that returns the type of the provided argument.
--- If the argument is a Discordia object, then this will return the name of its class; otherwise, it will return the result of calling Lua's global `type` function.
---
--- ```lua
--- print(class.type(color)) -- 'Color'
--- print(class.type(1337)) -- 'number'
--- ```
--- @param obj any
--- @return string
function class.type(obj) end

--- Function that returns the number of each class instance currently alive (ie, not garbage collected) in table form.
---
--- ```lua
--- local data = class.profile()
--- for name, count in pairs(data) do
---	print(name, count)
--- end
--- ```
---@return table<string, number>
function class.profile() end

---@class enums
--- The Discord API uses numbers to represent certain data types.
--- For convenience, these are enumerated in Discord as special read-only tables, found in the main Discordia module.
--- All available enumerations are listed at the end of this page.
---
--- ```lua
--- local discordia = require('discordia')
--- local enums = discordia.enums
--- ```
---
--- Enumerations (enums) can be accessed like a regular Lua table, but they cannot be modified.
--- This is completely optional, but it is generally easier to use and read enumerations than it is to use and read plain numbers.
--- For example, given a text channel object, the following are logically equivalent:
---
--- ```lua
--- if channel.type == 0 then
---   print('This is a text channel!')
--- end
---
--- if channel.type == enums.channelType.text then
---   print('This is a text channel!')
--- end
---
--- print(enums.verificationLevel.low) -- 1
--- ```
---
--- Additionally, enumerations work in reverse.
--- If you have the number, but you want to recall the human-readable version, simply call the enum;
--- it will return a string if the enumeration is valid.
---
--- ```lua
--- print(enums.channelType(channel.type)) -- 'text'
--- print(enums.verificationLevel(1)) -- 'low'
--- ```
---
--- If necessary, custom enumerations can be written using the enum constructor:
---
--- ```lua
--- local fruit = enums.enum {
---	apple =  0,
---	orange = 1,
---	banana = 2,
---	cherry = 3,
--- }
--- ```
---
--- ## Discord Enumerations
---
--- The enumerations are designed to be compatible with the Discord API. They are not necessarily unique to Discordia.

---@generic T
---@param data T
---@return T enum The newly constructed enum
function enums.enum(data) end

--- Extensions related to tables
---@class ext.table
local tableExt = {}

--- Returns the total number of elements in a table. This uses the global `pairs` function and respects any `__pairs` metamethods.
---@param tbl table
---@return number
function tableExt.count(tbl) end

--- Returns the total number of elements in a table, recursively. 
--- If a table is encountered, it is recursively counted instead of being directly added to the total count. 
--- This uses the global `pairs` function and respects any `__pairs` metamethods.
---@param tbl table
---@return number
function tableExt.deepcount(tbl) end

--- Returns a copy of the original table, recursively. 
--- If a table is encountered, it is recursively deep-copied. Metatables are not copied.
---@param tbl table
---@return table
function tableExt.copy(tbl) end

--- Returns a copy of the original table, recursively. 
--- If a table is encountered, it is recursively deep-copied. Metatables are not copied.
---@param tbl table
---@return table
function tableExt.deepcopy(tbl) end

--- Reverses the elements of an array-like table in place.
---@param tbl any[]
function tableExt.reverse(tbl) end

--- Returns a copy of an array-like table with its elements in reverse order. 
--- The original table remains unchanged.
---@param tbl any[]
---@return any[]
function tableExt.reversed(tbl) end

--- Returns a new array-like table where all of its values are the keys of the original table.
---@param tbl table
---@return any[]
function tableExt.keys(tbl) end

--- Returns a new array-like table where all of its values are the values of the original table.
---@param tbl table
---@return any[]
function tableExt.values(tbl) end

--- Returns a random (index, value) pair from an array-like table.
---@param tbl any[]
---@return number, any
function tableExt.randomipair(tbl) end

--- Returns a random (key, value) pair from a dictionary-like table.
---@param tbl table
---@return any, any
function tableExt.randompair(tbl) end

--- Returns a copy of an array-like table sorted using Lua's `table.sort`.
---@param tbl any[]
---@param fn function
---@return any[]
function tableExt.sorted(tbl, fn) end

--- Iterates through a table until it finds a value that is equal to `value` according to the `==` operator. 
--- The key is returned if a match is found.
---@param tbl table
---@param value any
---@return any
function tableExt.search(tbl, value) end

--- Returns a new table that is a slice of the original, defined by the start and stop bounds and the step size. 
--- Default start, stop, and step values are 1, #tbl, and 1, respectively.

function tableExt.slice(tbl, start, stop, step) end

--- Utilities related to strings
---@class ext.string
local stringExt = {}

---@return table
---@overload fun(str: string):table
function stringExt.split(str, delim) end

--- Returns a new string with all whitespace removed from the left and right sides of the original string.
---@param str string
---@return string
function stringExt.trim(str) end

---@alias alignment string | "'left'" | "'right'" | "'center'"

--- Returns a new string that is padded up to the desired length. 
--- The alignment, either `left`, `right`, or `center` with left being the default, defines the placement of the original string. 
--- The default pattern is a single space.
---@param str string
---@param len number
---@param align alignment
---@param pattern string
---@return string
---@overload fun(str: string, len: number):string
---@overload fun(str: string, len: number, align: alignment):string
function stringExt.pad(str, len, align, pattern) end

--- Returns whether a string starts with a specified sub-string or pattern. 
--- The plain parameter is the same as that used in Lua's `string.find`.

---@param plain boolean
---@return boolean
---@overload fun(str: string, pattern: string):boolean
function stringExt.startswith(str, pattern, plain) end

--- Returns whether a string ends with a specified sub-string or pattern. 
--- The plain parameter is the same as that used in Lua's `string.find`.
---@param str string
---@param pattern string
---@param plain boolean
---@return boolean
---@overload fun(str: string, pattern: string):boolean
function stringExt.endswith(str, pattern, plain) end

--- Returns the Levenshtein distance between two strings. 
--- A higher number indicates a greater distance.
---@param str1 string
---@param str2 string
---@return number
function stringExt.levenshtein(str1, str2) end

--- Returns a string of random characters with the specified length. 
--- If provided, the min and max bounds cannot be outside 0 to 255. 
--- Use 32 to 126 for printable ASCII characters.
---@param len number
---@param min number
---@param max number
---@return string
---@overload fun(len: number):string
---@overload fun(len: number, min: number):string
function stringExt.random(len, min, max) end

--- Utilities related to math
---@class ext.math
local mathExt = {}

--- Returns a number that is at least as small as the minimum value and at most as large as the maximum value, inclusively. 
--- If the original number is already with the bounds, the same number is returned.
---@param n number
---@param min number
---@param max number
---@return number
function mathExt.min(n, min, max) end

--- Returns a number that is rounded to the nearest defined digit. 
--- The nearest integer is returned if the digit is omitted.
--- Negative values can be used for higher order places.
---@param n number
---@param digits number
---@return number
---@overload fun(n: number):number
function mathExt.round(n, digits) end

--- **Discordia** has some built-in Lua standard library extensions. 
--- These provide complementary or supplementary, commonly used functions that the Lua standard library does not provide.
---
--- Extensions can be used directly...
---
--- ```lua
--- local str = "  abc  "
--- print(discordia.extensions.string.trim(str)) -- "abc"
--- ```
---
--- ... or they can be loaded into the global tables:
---
--- ```lua
--- local str = "  abc  "
--- discordia.extensions.string()
--- print(string.trim(str)) -- "abc"
--- ```
---
--- Note that calling the whole extensions module will load all sub-modules:
---
--- ```lua
--- discordia.extensions()
--- ```

--- To write a Discordia application, the library's main module must be required. If it's in a deps or libs folder, simply require it by name.
--- If you've manually installed the library elsewhere, then you will need to provide a relative or full path to the Discordia directory.
---
--- ```lua
--- local discordia = require('discordia')
--- ```
---
--- ## Classes
---
--- Discordia has many custom classes. Some of them are instantiated only by the library and not by users.
--- The classes that may be safely instantiated by users are included in the Discordia module:
---
--- * Client
--- * Clock
--- * Color
--- * Date
--- * Deque
--- * Emitter
--- * Logger
--- * Mutex
--- * Permissions
--- * Stopwatch
--- * Time
---
--- ## Sub-Modules
---
--- In addition to classes, the Discordia module has some generic modules that may be helpful in writing your applications.
---
--- ### class
---
--- Used to create custom classes and provides tools for inspecting classes and class instances.
---
--- ### enums
---
--- Used to create custom enumerations or access a variety of pre-defined enumerations.
---
--- ### extensions
---
--- Extensions to the Lua standard library. Functions can be used directly or can be loaded into the Lua global tables.
---
--- ### package
---
--- Not to be confused with the global Lua module, this Discordia's literal package metadata, used to define the module when it is uploaded to lit, the Luvit Invention Toolkit.
---
--- ### storage
---
--- An empty table that can be used to store user data.
--- This may be used an alternative to storing values on class instances or in global variables, both of which are not recommended.
